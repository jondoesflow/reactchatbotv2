# Building Rapport (reactchatbotv2)

I am mentoring someone in Australia around the Power Platform. An issue is that we have a timezone problem, I am in the UK.  We started using Loom for asynchronous meetings.  The first iteration of Building Rapport (reactchatbotv1) was born:

After that, I decided to spin up another Custom GPT, but that was then behind the ChatGPT + subscription.  So I have come up with this.

This is Building Rapport (ReactChatBotv2), it allows for consultants to home their skills in consulting whislt also giving them an idea on their passion on what to build.
