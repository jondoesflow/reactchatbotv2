# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# reactchatbotv2

I am mentoring someone in Australia around the Power Platform. An issue is that we have a timezone problem, I am in the UK.  We started using Loom for asynchronous meetings.  The first iteration of Building Rapport (reactchatbotv1) was born:

After that, I decided to spin up another Custom GPT, but that was then behind the ChatGPT + subscription.  So I have come up with this.

This is ReactChatBotv2, it allows for consultants to home their skills in consulting whislt also giving them an idea on their passion on what to build.
